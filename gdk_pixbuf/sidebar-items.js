This function can create a bilevel clipping mask (black and white) and use it while painting the image. In the future, when the X Window System gets an alpha channel extension, it will be possible to do full alpha compositing onto arbitrary drawables. For now both cases fall back to a bilevel clipping mask."],["PixbufError","An error code in the `GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR` domain.
